### User Journey: 

#### As a user: 

- I want to see stunt double profiles on landing page
- I want to be able to drag a profile card (either to the bin for a ‘No’ or To a ‘Yes’ list for shortlisting)
- I  want to be able to use  a ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ buttons (alternative to drag)
- Once I have gone through the entire list I would like to see a list of all the ‘Yes’ profiles that I can then reach out to.
